IPython notebooks and other code used in creating my paper on working memory.

[State space trajectory analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mcleonard/wm_paper/blob/master/State%20space%20trajectories.ipynb)

Here, I look at how the state of the neurons I recorded from one rat changes over time during the performance of the task. The analysis follows the methods of [V. Mante, *et al.*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7474/full/nature12742.html)

[Example neurons](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mcleonard/wm_paper/blob/master/Example%20neurons.ipynb)

In this notebook, I look at the activity of individual neurons with respect to task variables such as past goals and future goals.

[Bayesian models of neural activity correlated with task variables](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mcleonard/wm_paper/blob/master/Goal%20selectivity.ipynb)

I built Bayesian models for analyzing the neural correlates of each neuron in the recorded population. In some cases, I apply one model to all the neurons individually, but I also built some heirarchical models to analyze the goal selectivity of all the units in one model.

[Task performance as a function of delay length](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mcleonard/wm_paper/blob/master/Delay%20performance.ipynb)

Here, I measure how long the rats can retain the information necessary to perform the task.
